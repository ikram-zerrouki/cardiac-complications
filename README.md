#  LLM-Based Predictor for Cardiac Surgery Complications

This project leverages **Large Language Models (LLMs)** : **Phi-2** and **Gemma-2B** fine-tuned with LoRA to predict **early post-operative complications** in cardiac surgery patients using structured clinical data.

The pipeline includes data preprocessing, augmentation with **CTGAN**, and fine-tuning of LLMs using **instruction-style prompts** to turn tabular clinical data into a question-answering task for generative models. Final predictions are evaluated with standard metrics and visualizations.

##  Project Summary

> "Can a language model accurately predict post-operative outcomes from patient data?"

To answer this, the pipeline:
- Prepares structured patient records into Q&A prompts
- Uses synthetic data generation (CTGAN) to enhance model training
- Fine-tunes lightweight LLMs in 4-bit precision using **PEFT (LoRA)**
- Evaluates model performance with real-world test cases

## 🚀 Objectives

- ✅ Predict early (<30 days) post-operative complications after cardiac surgery
- ✅ Generate synthetic training data using CTGAN
- ✅ Fine-tune LLMs (Phi-2, Gemma-2B) with LoRA adapters
- ✅ Evaluate and visualize classification performance
